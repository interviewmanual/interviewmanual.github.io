<h2 id="information-collected">Information Collected</h2>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so. For example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>

<p><strong>Email Signup:</strong> If you sign up for a newsletter you will share informaiton about yourself via the signup form, including your name and email address. Further information is collected when you interact with emails which are sent to you, for example, if you have opened the email to create aggregate statistics on the email open rate.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Information about your usage of this website. For example, information about the actions users perform – in other words, what you did, when and to what thing on a site (e.g. a button click). Information is also collected about what happens when you use this Site (e.g., page views) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).

<p><strong>Location Information:</strong> The approximate location of your device from your IP address is used by our web analytics platform, Google Analystics. This information is used to, for example, calculate how many people visit this website from certain geographic regions.</p>

<p><strong>Information from Cookies &amp; Other Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.
